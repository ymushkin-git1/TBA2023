        He played fifteen seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls.
        Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.
        He was integral in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,becoming a global cultural icon in the process.

    <h2>
        DRAFT PICK
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers).
        One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.
        Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan,
        in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.
        Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.

        Jordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela.
        He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal in the competition.
        A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics.
        The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale.
        Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.
        In 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the "Dream Team", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.
        The team went on to win two gold medals: the first one in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[201] and the second one in the 1992 Summer Olympics.
        He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.
        Jordan is undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.
