        DRAFT PICK
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        The Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first overall in the 1969 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, who were in only their second season of existence.<br />
        The Bucks had won a coin toss with the Phoenix Suns for the first pick.<br />
        He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets.<br />
        The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept only one offer from each team, he rejected the Nets' bid as too low.<br />
        Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge.<br />
        After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying: "A bidding war degrades the people involved.<br />
        It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want to think like that.<br /><br /><br />
