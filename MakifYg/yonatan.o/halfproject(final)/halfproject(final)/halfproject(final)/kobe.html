    <p class="info">
        Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd.<br />
        Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris.<br />
        He scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games.<br />
        As a rookie in 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel.<br />
        At the time, he was the second-youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days) and also became the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days).<br />
        Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.<br />
        Bryant was called "one of the greatest players in the history of our game" by NBA commissioner Adam Silver,[ and The New York Times wrote that he had "one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport.<br /><br />

        <h4>
            "league's greatest players of all time"
        </h4>
        <br />
    <p class="info">
        Reuters called him "arguably the best player of his generation", while both Sporting News and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s.<br />
        In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked him the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan.<br />
        Players including Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan.<br />
        The Press-Enterprise described Bryant as "maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history".<br />
        He was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise history. Both numbers he wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18, 2017.<br />
        In his first year of eligibility, Bryant was named a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, weeks after his death,[383] before being elected a couple of months later in April 2020.<br />
        His formal induction was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />
        In October 2021, Bryant was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
