    <h2>
        There are billions of basketball fans worldwide.<br />
        This is not surprising because basketball has evolved drastically throughout the years; <br />
        it now belongs at the forefront of sports entertainment.<br />
        The excitement in the sport never stops growing through the years as new athletic and competitive players are drafted.<br />
        We have witnessed hundreds of promising basketball talents come and go. But who among them do you think is the best?<br />
        This question inspired me to come up with a list of top 5 basketball players of all time.<br />
        As most of you might have noticed, most of the players included on this list are NBA Hall of Famers who are already retired. <br />
        I firmly believe that these talented players made a greater impact in the sport compared to most basketball stars today.<br />
        Although I’m amazed at how the new generation is continuing the exciting and competitive culture of basketball, we still can’t deny the fact that they have a long way to go before achieving what these legends have accomplished.<br />

        Shout out to every basketball fan out there like me! Have a good read everyone!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
