    <h1>LEBRON JAMES</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        LeBron Raymone James Sr. is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
        Nicknamed "King James", he is widely considered one of the greatest players ever and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.
        James has won four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, three All-Star MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals.
        James has scored the most points in the playoffs, the most career points (playoffs and regular seasons combined), the second most regular seasons points, and has the seventh most career assists.
        He has been selected an NBA All-Star 18 times, to the All-NBA Team a record 18 times, and to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times.
        He has competed in ten NBA Finals, the third most all time, including eight consecutively between 2011 and 2018.
        In 2021, James was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and in 2022 became the first and only player in NBA history to accumulate over 10,000 career points, rebounds, and assists.

        DRAFT PICK
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.
        In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.
        At the conclusion of the 2003–04 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.
        With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.
        Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.

        NATIONAL TEAM
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.
        He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[312] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.
        Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.
        James felt his limited playing time was a "lowlight" and believed he was not given "a fair opportunity to play"; his attitude during the Olympics was described as "disrespectful" by columnist Adrian Wojnarowski.
        At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.
        The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.
        James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.
