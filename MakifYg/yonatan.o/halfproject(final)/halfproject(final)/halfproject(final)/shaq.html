        THE START
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        haquille Rashaun O'Neal, known commonly as "Shaq" , is an American former professional basketball player who is a sports analyst on the television program Inside the NBA
        O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.<br />
        He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion.<br />
        After playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft.<br />
        He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals.<br />
        After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002.<br />
        Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006.<br />
        Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.<br />
        O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.<br /><br /><br />

    <h3>
        DRAFT PICK
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        The Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft.
        In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.<br />
        O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[25] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.<br />
        During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season.<br />
        He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.<br />
        The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers.<br />
        On more than one occasion during the year, Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, "We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].<br /><br /><br />

    <h4>
        MAKING HISTORY
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p class="info">
        In the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected.<br />
        After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.<br />
        On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.<br />
        O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.<br /><br /><br /><br />
