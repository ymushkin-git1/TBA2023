    <div id="Magic">
        One of the most ebullient personalities to ever play in the NBA, Johnson’s charm was a major factor
        in the massive increase in the league’s popularity during the 1980s. But he was so much more than
        a dazzling smile. Johnson’s otherworldly passing set the stage for the “Showtime” L.A. Lakers teams
        that captured five championships during his 13 years with the franchise. The 6’9” Johnson
        (making him the NBA’s tallest point guard) not only posted the best assists-per-game mark in league
        history (11.2) but had a tremendous all-around game, as well. Famously, he played center in place of
        the injured Abdul-Jabbar in the title-clinching game six of the 1980 NBA finals as a 20-year-old rookie.
        Oh, and while this has nothing to do with his ranking on this list, it’s still incredibly awesome
        and noteworthy that he has successfully fought off HIV for over two decades, helped de-stigmatize
        AIDS through his high-profile advocacy, and launched a second career as an entrepreneur who opens
        businesses predominantly in poverty-stricken areas in efforts to spur urban revitalization.
        So, yeah, Magic Johnson—neat guy.
