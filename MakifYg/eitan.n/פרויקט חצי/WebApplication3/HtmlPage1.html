        Yes, the man many fans (ignorantly) consider the most overrated choke artist in the league is actually the
        best player to ever set foot on a court. LeBron James just does things that shouldn’t be humanly possible.
        He’s bigger than a good portion of the players in the NFL and yet he still moves as gracefully as the most
        nimble guards in basketball. Moreover, he not only faced the incredible pressure of being anointed “The Chosen One”
        by Sports Illustrated as a teenager, but he’s actually exceeded the lofty expectations set for him.
        As magnificent as earlier players were, they never had to deal with the 24/7 stresses of 21st century media,
        which James has with aplomb. Through the publication of this list, James has averaged a Robertson-esque
        27.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 6.9 steals per game and—unlike the Big O—he was doing so against teams stocked
        with elite athletes and not players who smoked cigarettes at halftime. When people knocked him for not winning
        championships early in his career, they overlooked that he almost single-handedly took an overmatched Cleveland
        Cavaliers squad to the 2007 NBA finals at just 22 years old. And, of course, he’s since won two titles (and counting?)
        as a member of the Miami Heat. Not only does he routinely pull off feats that I’ve never before seen, he has
        consistently evolved his game to fix the relative weak spots he was previously criticized for.
        Pretty much all you can ask for from the best ever, no?

    <h3 id="h3"> Early Life Of Lebron :</h3>
    <div class="lebron" id="le">
        James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth.
        22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.
        When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment
        in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would
        be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker,
        a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old. 23 James began
        playing organized basketball in the fifth grade. He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball
        for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[18] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by
        James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. 24  The group dubbed themselves the
        "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school together. 27  In a move that stirred
        local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with
        predominantly white students.
