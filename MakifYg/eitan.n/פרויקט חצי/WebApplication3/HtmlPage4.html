        Admittedly, Chamberlain played at a time when post players were significantly smaller and basketball wasn’t
        drawing the types of athletic marvels we see today, but the man was so incredibly dominant that he deserves
        a spot in the top five regardless of context. The four highest all-time NBA single-season scoring averages
        all belong to Chamberlain…in his first four professional seasons. The most notable of his scoring feats
        came on March 2, 1962, when he put up an astounding 100 points in a game, an NBA record that will likely
        never be broken. In addition to his unprecedented prowess at putting up points, Chamberlain was also the
        only person to grab more rebounds per game than Bill Russell (22.9), all while averaging more minutes played
        per game than any player in league history (45.8). The one time in his 14-year career that he was not an
        All-Star was in 1970, a season in which an injured Chamberlain was limited to just 12 regular-season games
        and yet he still managed to will his team to the NBA finals upon his return.
