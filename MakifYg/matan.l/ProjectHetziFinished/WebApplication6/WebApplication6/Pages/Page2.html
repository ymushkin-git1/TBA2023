            Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. <br />
            Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio <br /> and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. <br />
            Also starring are Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton. <br />

            Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed <br />with the human loss would be essential <br /> to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. <br />
            Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. <br />
            The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh,<br /> which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. <br />
            Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. <br />
            The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America<br /> while the latter released the film internationally. <br />
            It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million.<br />

            Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. <br />
            Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, <br /> including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director,<br /> tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. <br />
            With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. <br />
            It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until another Cameron film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. <br />
            A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, <br /> pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.195 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). <br />
            In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".<br />

    <p2 id="section2">
        <b>
            In 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS Titanic.
            They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean.
            Instead, they only find a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace.
            The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the Titanic struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.
            Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh. She recounts her experiences aboard Titanic.

            In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon "Cal" Hockley, and Rose's widowed mother, Ruth, board the Titanic.
            Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status.
            Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game.
            After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to jump overboard.
            Jack appears and coaxes her back onto the deck. The two develop a tentative friendship.
            When Cal and Ruth strongly object, Rose acquiesces and discourages Jack's attention, but upon realizing she has fallen in love with him,
            she returns to him and he reciprocates.

            Rose brings Jack to her state room and pays him a coin to sketch her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean necklace.
            They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold.
            On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing the serious situation.
            Cal discovers Jack's sketch and Rose's insulting note left inside his safe, along with the necklace.
            When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft.
            Jack is then confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal then puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.

            With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat.
            Rose finds and frees Jack, and they barely make it back to the boat deck. Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat.
            Having arranged to save himself, Cal falsely claims he can get Jack safely off the ship.
            As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back on board.
            Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon.
            They get away, and Cal realizes that he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose;
            he later boards a lifeboat posing as a lost child's father.
