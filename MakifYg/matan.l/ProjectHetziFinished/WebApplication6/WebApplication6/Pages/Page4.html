            The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). <br />
            Warner Bros Pictures An adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, <br />
            the film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming (who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind), <br />
            and stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. <br />
            Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. <br />
            The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with the lyrics written by Edgar "Yip" Harburg.<br />

            Characterized by its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters, <br />The Wizard of Oz was moderately successful upon its original release of August 25, 1939. <br />
            The film was considered a critical success and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, <br />winning in two categories: Best Original Song for "Over the Rainbow" and Best Original Score by Stothart. <br />
            While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, <br />earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, <br />
            not including promotional costs, which made it MGM's most expensive production at that time.<br />

            The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on the CBS network reintroduced the film to the public;<br /> according to the U.S. Library of Congress, <br />
            it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation <br />in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". <br />
            It is also one of the few films on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI (British Film Institute) <br />list of "50 films to be seen by the age of 14", <br />
            and is on the BFI's updated list of "50 films to be seen by the age of 15" released in May 2020.<br />

            The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. <br />
            The film ranks often on critics' lists of greatest films of all time, and is the most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baum's work.<br />

    <p2 id="section2">
        <b>
            Teenager Dorothy Gale lives on a Kansas farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em.
            When Dorothy's dog Toto bites the wealthy Almira Gulch, Miss Gulch obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize the dog to be euthanized.
            Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller,
            tells Dorothy to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. Dorothy returns just as a tornado approaches the farm.
            Unable to get into the locked storm shelter, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious by the violence of the storm.
            The tornado then lifts the house and drops it into an unknown land.

            Dorothy awakens and is greeted by short people known as Munchkins, and a "good" witch named Glinda,
            who explains to Dorothy that she is in Munchkinland in the land of Oz.
            The Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East.
            Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, appears in a puff of smoke. Before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers,
            Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on, as they must be very powerful.
            Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves in another puff of smoke, but only after telling Dorothy,
            "I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!" Glinda knows of only one person who might know how to
            help Dorothy return home: The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy is directed to follow a yellow brick road that goes to the Emerald City, the Wizard's home.

            Along the way, she meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage.
            The foursome and Toto eventually reach the Emerald City, despite the best efforts of the Wicked Witch.
            Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his doorman. The doorman relents on hearing that they were sent by Glinda,
            and the four are led into the Wizard's chambers.
            The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick.

            During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her.
            The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion free Dorothy, but are pursued by the Witch and her guards. They are cornered by the Witch,
            who sets fire to the Scarecrow. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch,
            which causes her to melt away.
            The Witch's guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick. The four return to the Wizard,
            but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the Wizard is revealed to be just an ordinary man,
            operating machinery that projects the ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront him, upon which he confesses that he,
            like Dorothy, accidentally arrived in Oz from America.
            He then "grants" the wishes of Dorothy's three friends by giving them tokens that symbolize that they always had the qualities they sought.
