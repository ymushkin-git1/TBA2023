            Star Wars (retroactively titled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written <br />and directed by George Lucas,
            produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.<br /> It is the first film in the Star Wars film series and fourth chronological chapter of the "Skywalker Saga".<br />
            Set "a long time ago" in a fictional universe where the galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical Galactic Empire, <br />
            the story focuses on a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance, who aim to destroy the Empire's newest weapon,<br /> the Death Star. <br />
            Luke Skywalker becomes caught in the conflict while learning the ways of a metaphysical power known as "the Force"<br /> from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. <br />
            The cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse,<br /> James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew.<br />
            Lucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of Flash Gordon around the time he completed his first film, <br />
            THX 1138 (1971) and began working on a treatment after the release of American Graffiti (1973). After numerous rewrites, <br />
            filming took place throughout 1975 and 1976 in locations including Tunisia and Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England.<br /> The film suffered production difficulties; <br />
            cast and crew involved believed the film would be a failure. Lucas formed the production company Industrial <br />Light & Magic to help create the film's special effects. <br />
            It also went $3 million over budget due to multiple delays.<br />

            Star Wars was released in a limited number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977 and quickly became a blockbuster hit, <br />
            leading to it being expanded to a much wider release. The film opened to critical acclaim for its acting, direction, story, musical score, <br />
            sound, editing, screenplay, costume design, and production values, but particularly for its groundbreaking visual effects. It grossed over $550 million during its initial run, <br />
            surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. <br />
            When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America (behind Gone with the Wind) and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time. <br />
            It received numerous awards at the Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, Saturn Awards, among others.<br />

    <p2 id="section2">
        <b>
            Amid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star,
            a massive space station capable of destroying entire planets. Imperial Senator Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan,
            secretly one of the Rebellion's leaders, has obtained its schematics,
            but her starship is intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the command of the ruthless Darth Vader.
            Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory system of astromech droid R2-D2,
            who flees in an escape pod to the nearby desert planet Tatooine alongside his companion, protocol droid C-3PO.

            The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their step-nephew Luke Skywalker.
            While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a holographic recording of Leia requesting help from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
            Later, after Luke finds R2-D2 missing, he is attacked by scavenging Sand People while searching for him,
            but is rescued by elderly hermit "Old Ben" Kenobi, an acquaintance of Luke's, who reveals he is indeed Obi-Wan.
            He tells Luke of his days as one of the Jedi Knights,
            the former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who drew mystical abilities from a metaphysical energy field known as "the Force",
            but were ultimately hunted to near-extinction by the Empire.
            Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil,
            turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan offers Luke his father's old lightsaber, the signature weapon of Jedi Knights.

            R2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan
            and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis.
            Although Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force,
            he is left with no choice after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm
            in their search for the droids. Traveling to a cantina in Mos Eisley to search for transport, Luke and Obi-Wan hire Han Solo,
            a smuggler with a price on his head due to his debt to local mobster Jabba the Hutt. Pursued by stormtroopers, Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2,
            and C-3PO flee Tatooine with Han and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca on their ship the Millennium Falcon.
            Before the Falcon can reach Alderaan, Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin destroys
            the planet in a show of force after interrogating Leia for the location of the Rebel Alliance's base.
            Upon arrival, the Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam,
            but the group evades capture by hiding in the ship's smuggling compartments. As Obi-Wan leaves to disable the tractor beam,
            Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia after discovering that she is scheduled to be executed.
            After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader,
            allowing the rest of the group to escape the Death Star with Leia. Using a tracking device,
            the Empire tracks the Falcon to the hidden Rebel base on Yavin IV.
