        <b>
            The hobbit, Sméagol, is fishing with his cousin Déagol, who discovers the One Ring in the river.
            Sméagol's mind is ensnared by the Ring, and he kills his cousin for it. Increasingly corrupted physically and mentally,
            he retreats into the Misty Mountains and becomes known as Gollum.

            Centuries later, during the War of the Ring, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden of Rohan to Isengard,
            where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír,
            and the group returns to Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm's Deep. Pippin looks into the palantír,
            seeing Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith;
            he rides there to warn Gondor's steward Denethor. Pippin, who accompanies him, swears fealty to Denethor,
            whose now-dead heir Boromir had saved his life; on Gandalf's instruction, he triggers the lighting of the beacons,
            which call for help from Rohan.

            Frodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now their guide,
            plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witness the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine Nazgûl,
            setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum conspires to frame Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring;
            influenced by the growing power of the Ring, Frodo is taken in by the deception, and orders Sam to go home.
            Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum,
            who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyzes, and binds Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam,
            who, mourning Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring. Sam realizes his mistake when a group of Orcs takes Frodo captive,
            but manages to rescue Frodo as the Orcs fight among themselves. Now inside Mordor, the hobbits continue towards Mount Doom, their destination.

            As King Théoden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave Middle-earth.
            Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, reforged from the shards of King Elendil's sword Narsil,
            and urges him to commit to claiming Gondor's throne, to which he is heir. Joined by Legolas and Gimli,
            Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead, and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should they come to Gondor's aid.
            Meanwhile, Faramir, who was earlier overwhelmed and driven back to Minas Tirith by the Witch-king, is gravely wounded in a suicide charge;
            believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf marshals the defenders, but the huge Orc army breaks into the city.
            Denethor attempts to burn himself and Faramir on a pyre, but Pippin alerts Gandalf and they rescue Faramir.
            Denethor, set ablaze and in agony, jumps to his death.

            Théoden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success against Orcs in the ensuing battle,
            they are decimated by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim and the Witch-king mortally wounds Théoden; however,
            his niece Éowyn slays the Witch-king with Merry's help. Théoden dies in his niece's arms. Aragorn then arrives with his Army of the Dead,
            who overcome Sauron's forces. Legolas slays a Mûmakil and its guards, which Gimli denounces for "That still only counts as one!" and the battle is won.
            Their oath fulfilled, the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn decides to march on Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo,
            now extremely weak, and Sam; all of Sauron's remaining forces march to meet Aragorn's diversion, allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom.
            Gollum, who survived his earlier fall, attacks them, but Frodo still manages to enter the mountain. There, he succumbs to the Ring's power,
            putting it on his finger, but Gollum manages to bite off his finger and reclaim it. They struggle together and both fall off the ledge.
            Frodo clings to it with one hand as remorse and guilt flood his mind in the wake of his succumbing to the ring,
            when Sam's unwavering faith and belief in his friend convinces him to make one final reach for Sam's hand, saving Frodo's life.
            Gollum falls and dies; the Ring, which fell with him, disintegrates in the lava, causing Barad-dûr to crumble as The Eye of Sauron explodes,
            destroying the dark lord once and for all. Aragorn's army emerges victorious as its enemies and the lands of Mordor collapse into the earth,
            and Mount Doom erupts, with Frodo and Sam narrowly escaping the lava.
