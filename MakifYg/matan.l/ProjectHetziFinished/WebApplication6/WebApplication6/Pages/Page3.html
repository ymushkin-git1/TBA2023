            E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (or simply E.T.) is a 1982 American science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg <br /> and written by Melissa Mathison. <br />
            It tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial, dubbed E.T., who is left behind on Earth. <br />
            Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. <br />
            The film stars Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton and Drew Barrymore.<br />

            The film's concept was based on an imaginary friend that Spielberg created after his parents' divorce. <br />
            In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project Night Skies. <br />
            In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled E.T. and Me, which went through two rewrites. <br />
            The project was rejected by Columbia Pictures, who doubted its commercial potential. <br /> Universal Pictures eventually purchased the script for $1 million. <br />
            Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. <br />
            Unlike most films, E.T. was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. <br />
            The animatronics for the film were designed by Carlo Rambaldi. <br />

            E.T. premiered as the closing film of the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. <br />
            The film was an immediate blockbuster, surpassing Star Wars to become the highest-grossing film of all time, <br /> a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg's own Jurassic Park surpassed it in 1993. <br />
            E.T. was widely acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. <br />
            It received nine nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing, and also won five Saturn Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. <br />
            The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects and additional scenes. <br />
            It was also re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, who deemed it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." <br />

    <p2 id="section2">
        <b>
            Alien botanists secretly visit Earth at night to gather specimens in a California forest.
            One of them separates from the group, fascinated by the distant city lights, but U.S. government vehicles arrive and chase the startled creature.
            The other aliens depart, abandoning him on Earth. In a nearby neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley,
            ten-year-old Elliott Taylor's suspicions are roused when he pitches a baseball into a tool shed,
            and the ball is thrown back. Later that night, Elliott returns with a flashlight, discovering the creature among the cornstalks.
            He shrieks and flees the scene.

            Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves a trail of candy to lure the alien into his house.
            Before bed, he realizes the alien is imitating his movements. The next morning,
            Elliott feigns sickness to stay home from school and play with him. He can "feel" the alien's thoughts and emotions,
            shown when the alien accidentally opens an umbrella, startling him and simultaneously Elliott several rooms away.

            Later that day, Elliott introduces his older brother Michael and seven-year-old sister Gertie to the alien,
            deciding to keep him hidden from their mother, Mary. When the children ask the alien about his origins,
            he shows them by levitating several balls, representing his planetary system, and demonstrates his powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.
            He demonstrates his healing power, through his glowing fingertip, on a minor cut on Elliott's finger.

            At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a much stronger empathic connection with the alien,
            including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because the alien is at Elliott's home, drinking beer and watching television)
            and freeing the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man on television,
            Elliott kisses a girl he likes similarly and is sent to the principal's office.

            The alien dubs himself "E.T.", reading a comic strip where Buck Rogers, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device,
            and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. gets Elliott's help to build a device to "phone home" by using a Speak & Spell.
            Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we". Throughout this, the boys are unaware that E.T.
            is being tracked by government agents and that all three of them are being spied on.
            On Halloween night, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost to sneak him out. Elliott and E.T. head through the forest,
            where they successfully call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, finding E.T. gone.
            Elliott returns home to his worried family. Michael discovers E.T. dying next to a culvert and takes him home to an also-dying Elliott.
            Mary becomes horrified upon discovering her son's illness and the dying alien,
            just as a group of government agents dressed in biohazard suits led by "Keys" invades the house.
