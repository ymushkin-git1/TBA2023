    <h1> Diego Maradona </h1>

    <div class="P1">
        <br>
        Diego Armando Maradona (30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional football player and manager.<br>
        Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, <br>
        he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award.<br>
        Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature,<br>
        which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players.<br>
        His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance,<br>
        while he would often be singled out by the opposition.<br>
        A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.<br>
        <br>
        Nicknames: El Diez, El Pibe de Oro, Cosmico.
