    <h1>General Q&A</h1>
    <p> this page is a simple one, your are gonna find answeres for common yet important questions about fitness.</p>
    <h2>How much should I exercise?</h2>
    <p>
        Like many questions, the answer depends on your goals, however the best tip I can give you is to listen to your body. If you feel like <br />
        you need to rest, rest. For starters however I recommed to start exercising 3 times a week.
    </p>
    <h2>How much should I rest between workouts?</h2>
    <p>
        For starters I recommend resting around 1 to 2 days between every workout.
    </p>
    <h2>How much should I eat?</h2>
    <p>
        Like I showed you in the Calorie calculator page, It also depend's on your goals, if you want to lose bodyfat, burn more than you consume, <br />
        if you want to fain muscle and fat consume more than you burn.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I get stronger overtime</h2>
    <p>
        By progressively loading the muscle with harder exercises and more weight/repetitions over time.
    </p>
    <h2>body weight or the gym</h2>
    <p> you can gain muscle and strentgh by doing either of them, as long as you proggressively overload the muscle it will grow bigger and stronger.</p>
    <h2>how long should my workouts be</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of excercises A good range would be 6-8, in terms of time a workout shouldn't take more than 9
        <script src="JavaScript.js"></script>0 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>What happens if I miss some workouts</h2>
    <p>Missing a couple of workouts is ok and wouldn't be too bad. However after around 3 weeks of not exercising you will start losing muscle mass.</p>
