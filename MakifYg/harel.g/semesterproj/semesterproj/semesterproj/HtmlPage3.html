    <h1>No Equipment Exercises</h1>
    <p>
        the following exercises are some basic compound movements that you can do without any equipment other than a local sport's garden. all of these exercises are
        great for starting out, they cover most of the body's muscles and will make you stronger over time. I would personally recommend you to start from three sets of 12
        repetitions, if it's hard do less repetitions or try an easier veriation. If you it is too easy maybe try and increase the repetitions or do a harder veriation.
