    <h1>My Personal Story</h1>
    <p id="pstorytext">
        My fitness journey started around two months after my 14th birthday. I used to be really skinny, not athletic and physically weak. <br />
        I was insecure about these things and I wanted to change them, so I signed up for a gym membership. I had a few friends join with me. <br />
        We got our own training programs and we started going to the gym regularly. We were going three times a week and it has become a habbit very quickly.
        Around half a year into the journey we started seeing results, people startet complimenting us telling us that we got bigger. It was nice to hear <br />
        but to be honest it wasn't what was keeping us going, it was the fun we had. We loved experementing with different excersises and seeing what we like<br />
        the most, we loved getting stronger and adding weight to the machines, we loved chatting with people in the gym and getting to know new people and eating healthier. <br />
        <br />
        It has been aroud 20 months since I joined the gym And I can confidentally say that it was one of my best decisions.<br />
        It gave me expriences that I would never forget, relationships with peeople I would have never met otherwise and the confidence to talk to them.<br />
        I built this website to inspire people to incoroperate fitness into their lives and to show them it is very simple.
