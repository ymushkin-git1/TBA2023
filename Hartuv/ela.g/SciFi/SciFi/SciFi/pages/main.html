            Maybe you're aware of it and maybe you don't. But not so many years ago saying out loud that you're a fan of comics, robots, aliens or science fiction in general was an invitation to be beaten. But today, science fiction is everywhere you look. The two most successful films of all time: science fiction. Top-grossing and best-selling franchises: Heavy science fiction. Which series and films keep coming out: a lot, which are science fiction. So the question arises...

        <p class="pl">On and off the screen, science fiction fans (geeks) have not been portrayed in the most positive way but as crazy people who believe in aliens, losers with no social skills or people who are unable to distinguish between reality and imagination. Today there is a turn in the way we see science fiction and its fans and as mentioned it is a positive one.</p>
        <p class="pl">Science fiction was not common in the past (early 20th century) and the main way to consume it was through pulp magazines such as Air Wonder Stories, Astonishing Stories and Amazing Stories. These magazines in addition to reading stories made it possible to send letters and soon people who may not have known anyone else who liked sci-fi could send each other email and communicate about topics they couldn't with other people. This is how sci-fi fans became a larger community (so to some extent you could say that Pulp gave birth to fandom).</p>
        <p class="pl">Within the sci-fi fan community, love for the genre only grew when films like War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planets, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Them! They began to flood the screen at the height of the golden age of science fiction. These films only amplified the fascinating ideas of science fiction and marketed it to a slightly wider audience. However, with the beginning of the sixties, small publishers were forced to close, which led to the closure of most of the pulp magazines.</p>
        <img class="expic" id="right" src="../pic/quiz/watchtv/Star Trek The Original Series.jpg" />
        <p class="pl">But there is no reason to worry because at the beginning of the sixties a small, short and unknown sci-fi series appeared called 'Star Trek'.</p>
        <p class="pl">A series that follows the journeys of the crew of the spaceship Enterprise (especially its charismatic captain Kirk and his alien and calculating right-hand man Spock) as they explore the unknown.</p>
        <p class="pl">Despite the niche viewership of the series, its fans were excessive and as soon as rumors began that the series was going to be cancelled, they sent hundreds of letters and three years after its cancellation, the 'Star Trek Live' convention was held, which was the largest fan convention up until that moment. Still, the Trekis (Star Trek fans) and their ilk were a joke and it would take a big hit from Star Trek to change that...</p>

        <p class="pl">In 1977, George Lucas published his space opera Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, which contrary to what the studios and George Lucas himself expected, the film became an immediate and phenomenal success and was even nominated for best picture at the Oscars and won anther six. Almost for the first time, both fans, critics and the general public were enthusiastic about science fiction. Star Wars gathered a cult of fans and opened a new world of science fiction to the general public.</p>
        <p class="pl">Thousands upon thousands of people watched the sequel and today Star Wars is one of the most successful franchises ever. Although quality science fiction films were released in the previous years, Star Wars marked a new way to make films (and profit from them).</p>
        <p class="pl">In the following years, more and more science fiction films began to be released, even Star Trek Month!. And now the films have already received a significantly larger budget and have been marketed to the general public. Heavy science fiction was still for specific people but every single person had at least one work of science fiction that they loved or connected to.</p>
        <p class="pl">Today, geekiness in general is more accepted than it used to be and other geek topics are popular. We live in a world where Star Wars and superheroes rule the screen, Avatar is the most successful film and arguably one of the most popular Netflix series follows a bunch of kids who play D&D, Star Wars fans and dress up as Ghostbusters on Halloween and the other is a heavy sci-fi series that started as an imitation of Back to the Future .</p>
