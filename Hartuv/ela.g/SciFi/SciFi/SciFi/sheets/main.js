    document.getElementById("ch1").innerHTML = "A common problem with many genres such as horror, fantasy or animation is a lack of appreciation from critics."
    document.getElementById("ch2").innerHTML = "The invented elements and epic stories sometimes prevent critics from looking at the story as a serious work. Especially in the case of science fiction that resulted from, among other things, the books of Jules Verne or stories like Gulliver's Travels which only convinced the critics more that science fiction is a children's business. There is even a subgenre called 'social science fiction' which is used as an excuse by critics whenever they find their way to a serious science fiction book with good ideas. This is how it is easy to say 'it's not good sci fi because it isn't science fiction, it is something else...' even that social criticism and ideas are so important and rooted in sci-fi as a genre. And many science fiction writers who called their books works of social science fiction even objected to the title themselves for the same reasons."
    document.getElementById("ch3").innerHTML = "As I said the main way to consume science fiction in the early 20th century was through pulp magazines and admittedly, there were quite a few readers of the stories, but from the point of view of critics, they were considered trash, and the fact that they were called pulp magazines after the cheap, high-quality paper they were printed on didn't help."
    document.getElementById("ch4").innerHTML = "In addition, the newfound popularity of the genre (more on that later) has only strengthened critics' disdain for science fiction even today. Many critics point out that although the Star Wars films are good their effects on culture, literature and cinema are devastating. Even respected filmmakers like Scorsese say that today, all the films that come out are superhero films or similar films whose low qualities are destroying the cinema."
    document.getElementById("ch5").innerHTML = "Although the genre is still critically ignored, the situation is better than it was. The works of writers in the new wave who took the exaggerated stories from the pulp magazines and placed the human soul at the center, marked the genre in a different light to the critics. So there is still a way to go but not such a long way."
