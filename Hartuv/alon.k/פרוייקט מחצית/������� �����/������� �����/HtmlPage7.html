        Birmingham is the second largest city in the United Kingdom, after London. It is one of the metropolitan areas of Great Britain, and it is in the center of the West Midlands metropolitan area, in the center of England (it was previously in Warwickshire). As of 2015, about 1.1 million people live there.

        The city gained fame as the leader of the industrial revolution in England and as a result received the nickname "the workshop of the world" or "the city of a thousand crafts". Even after the industrial and economic importance of the city decreased, Birmingham is still considered the third most important city in the field of industry and commerce in Great Britain and the 21st most important in Europe as a whole.
