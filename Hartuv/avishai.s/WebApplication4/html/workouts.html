    <h2>full body workut</h2>

    <p>
        Everyone needs their own workout plan. Here is the main reason to do a fullbody workout<br />
        <h4>Lower Time Commitment</h4>
        The first benefit to using full body workout programs is that there is a much lower time requirement to perform them.<br />
        If you're someone who has something on the go every night of the week, it can be hard to fit in a four-day-a-week gym program.<br />
        Since full body workouts can be performed over the course of just two or three days a week, this allows more time for other obligations in your life.<br />
        Depending on how you structure the full body workout program you may find they do take slightly longer in the gym to complete,<br />
        but when you consider the overall weekly time commitment they require, you'll still end up much further ahead than with other programs such as the upper/lower body split.<br />
        some other side benefits are more rest time and more time to do other life activitis<br />

    <h2 id="ppl">PPL - push/pull/legs</h2>
    <h4>What Is The Push/Pull/Legs Split Routine?</h4>
    <p>
        The push/pull/legs split is a very simple training method in which you split your body into three parts. And each part is then trained on its own separate day<br />
        In the “push” workout you train all the upper body pushing muscles, i.e. the chest, shoulders and triceps.<br />
        In the “pull” workout you train all the upper body pulling muscles, i.e. the back and biceps.<br />
        And in the “legs” workout you train the entire lower body, i.e. the quads, hamstrings, calves and abdominals.<br />
        These three workouts are then alternated over however many weekly training sessions you choose to do.<br />
        So for instance if you can only make it to the gym three days per week, you would simply do each workout on its own set day once each week, e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday.<br />
        However this is not the best way to do it as it means that each body part is only being trained once per week, <br />
        and as I’ve said previously this is not optimal for muscle growth (though it’s fine for a maintenance program).<br />
        So a better way would be to train four days per week, alternating the workouts over your four training sessions.<br />
        It doesn’t matter which days you choose as long as you never do more than two days in a row.<br />
        Another method is the rotating five day cycle, where each workout is done over a five day period. So this means you would train 2 on, 1 off, 1 on, 1 off and then repeat.<br />
        This is probably the best way to do it as it means that each body part is trained once every 5 days<br />
        – and this is about ideal for the more experienced trainee. But it does mean that your training days are constantly changing so you need a fairly flexible schedule for this to work<br />

    <h4>Why Use A Push/Pull/Legs Split?</h4>
    <p>
        The push/pull/legs split is probably the most efficient workout split there is because all related muscle groups are trained together in the same workout.<br />
        This means that you get the maximum overlap of movements within the same workout, and the muscle groups being trained get an overall benefit from this overlap.<br />
        For example when you train chest with say bench press, you are also hitting your anterior deltoids and triceps hard. And when you train shoulders you are again involving your triceps<br />
        . So it makes sense to work these all together in the same workout for maximum synergy and effectiveness.<br />
        Similarly when you train your back your biceps are heavily involved, so it again makes sense to train these immediately afterwards so that they can derive the maximum benefit from the additional stimulation.<br />
        It also means you will have minimum overlap of movements between workouts, and this will facilitate better recovery than most other body part splits.<br />

    <h2 id="up">upper lower split 4 days</h2>
    <h4>What Is The Upper/Lower Split?</h4>
    <p>
        The upper/lower split is among the most popular ways to organize your training.<br />
        The idea behind it is very simple: You split your training into upper body exercise days and lower body exercise days.<br />
        The most common way is to spread your weekly training volume across four workouts – two upper, and two lower. For example:<br />
        Weekly Schedule<br />
        Monday – Upper<br />
        Tuesday – Lower<br />
        Wednesday – Off<br />
        Thursday – Upper<br />
        Friday – Lower<br />
        Saturday & Sunday – Off<br />
        On Upper days, you will work out all the major muscle groups like back, chest, biceps, triceps, traps, and abs.<br />
        On the Lower workout, you will train all of the lower body’s major muscles – glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves.<br />
    </p>
    <h4>begginer friendly routine</h4>
    <p>
        The total amount of volume in this workout routine is appropriate for a beginner level trainee.<br />
        If you wanted to make it more advanced, you could simply continue to increase the weights used over time or by upping the volume by adding additional sets.<br />
        All workout routines can be used by all levels of experience. It’s more or less a matter of knowing how to make your training most effective based on your goals, capabilities, and lifestyle.<br />
