    <p>
        We’ve said it enough times in Muscle & Fitness but it bears repeating: You don’t grow in the gym.<br />
        You grow while you recover.<br />

        You also get faster, leaner and stronger while you recover, so it stands to reason that you should be making this a priority.<br />
        But recovery isn’t simply a matter of post-workout protein and waxy maize – it’s a matter of rest.<br />
        Or, more specifically, sleep.<br />

        While a great many of us build our schedules around workouts, fewer of us offer the same deference to our sleep,<br />
        choosing instead to stay up late for zombies, or wake up at sunrise to catch some empty stomach cardio.<br />
        But this lack of devotion to sleep might just be the missing element in your quest for a better body.<br />
        Muscle-building, fat-burning and athletic performance are all diminished by sleep deprivation.<br />
        You may not feel deprived but the pounds you’re lifting – or carrying around your waistline – may tell a different story.<br />
    </p>
    <h1> THE GROWTH FACTOR </h1>
    <p>
        Newborns sleep somewhere in the neighborhood of 18 hours per day but they’re not being lazy.<br />
        They’re taking advantage of the wonders of growth hormone (GH).<br />
        Babies are in a constant rebuilding phase as they grow and a cascade of hormones is governing this process.<br />
        Without the proper amount of rest, they would not be able to secrete the right amount of GH,<br />
        a critical hormone in building up tissues that peaks as you sleep.<br />

        So it makes sense that if you want to recover and grow, you also need to sleep to secrete enough GH.<br />
        Sleep is – wait for it – the the most anabolic thing you can do for your muscles and if you’re not getting enough,<br />
        you’re just not growing as fast as you can.<br />
    </p>
    <h1> NO SLEEP? FAT CHANCE. </h1>
    <p>
        Folks who are underslept may think that they are more likely to burn fat than those who get more sleep,<br />
        “If I’m up and about, I’ll be burning more calories,”. They’d be right…and wrong.<br />

        Better, more efficient fat-burning can be had by catching more z’s.<br />
        Studies show that people that get less than six hours of sleep have poor insulin resistance.<br />
        If you cannot control insulin, you will have a tough time losing fat,<br />
        not to mention a much higher risk of developing Type II diabetes.<br />

        But there’s more. Lack of sleep also enhances your body’s production of the catabolic stress hormone cortisol.<br />
        Cortisol increases as you become more sleep deprived, which intern can alter thyroid stimulating hormone,<br />
        your key metabolic regulator. To reduce cortisol, you need to relax and sleep.<br />
        Too much cortisol has been shown to increase belly fat in males.<br />

        GH is also influential on your body’s ability to fight fat and, as we discussed above,<br />
        adequate sleep is imperative for gaining the full benefits of this wonder hormone.<br />

        Lack of sleep can also affect your hunger hormone, ghrelin, which can cause you to overeat.<br />
        Insulin secretion and the ability to respond to insulin can decrease up to 30 percent. <br />
        The better sleep you get, the better your growth hormone secretion, the less likely you are to store fat as you slumber.<br />
    </p>
    <h1> PERFORMANCE ANXIETY </h1>
    <p>
        You might not need to slap yourself in the face and grunt like a silverback before a big lift if you would just get enough sleep.<br />
        Simply getting enough time on your pillow may be enough of a boost to your performance in the gym.<br />
        Remember, heavy lifting is just as much cerebral as it is muscular. <br />
        That is to say that your central nervous system plays a much larger part than you’d think<br />
        when it comes to pushing through that new personal best on the bench.<br />

        There is a reason why your coach always told you to go to bed early before a game.<br />
        With lousy sleep comes lousy focus, compromising your central nervous system’s clout.<br />
        Your nervous system is responsible for power output, mental clarity, reaction and proprioception.<br />
        If you find a decrease in any of these attributes, <br />
        you lose the ability to perform at your optimal level<br />
        and this applies whether you’re playing your favorite sport or you’re gearing up for a set of heavy deadlifts.<br />

        From a physiological standpoint, fatigue diminishes energy output, stifles concentration skills and enhances distractability,<br />
        which makes it far easier to shirk on your workout responsibilities, <br />
        especially towards the end of a workout as physical fatigue compounds mental fatigue. <br />
        It is also not surprising that this lack of concentration can lead to a much greater risk of injury.<br />
        The slightest fatigue-induced deviation in form or improper muscle recruitment can leave you more bedridden than you want to be.<br />
    </p>
    <h1> MOODY BLUES </h1>
    <p>
        If you’re not sleeping enough,<br />
        not only will you be bummed out over how little progress you are making from your workouts and diet but you also run the risk of developing acute emotional abnormalities.<br />

        A lack of sleep contributes to a regular flow of stress hormones like cortisol,<br />
        and this intensifies our emotional response. That is a likely reason why we get more testy,<br />
        irritable, teary, or giggly when you are missing your winks.<br />

        Deep REM sleep is needed as it assists the brain in learning what it had acquired the day before and this includes movement patterns. <br />
        Proper REM sleep aid in enhanced memory and more efficient learning and helps to resupply one’s system with neurotransmitters that were used up during the previous day.<br />

        Forgetful today? Without REM, memories may dissipate.<br />
        If you learn a new athletic skill and fail to get a good night’s sleep then it’s as if you had never learned it.<br />
        You may remember elements of the skill, but it won’t be converted into long-term memory.<br />
        And this has huge implications for elite or hard-training athletes.<br />

        THE SLEEP SOLUTION
        So now you see: not getting enough sleep can (and will) impair your body’s ability to gain muscle,<br />
        burn fat, lift heavy weight or to do pretty much anything without being a zombie-eyed,<br />
        emotional wreck that yells at guys who don’t want to let you work in.<br />

        There is no magic one-size-fits-all prescription for the amount of sleep needed to keep your body and brain performing at optimal levels.<br />
        Some people can indeed get by with less sleep and some really need more in order to get by.<br />
        But studies show that people who get between 7-9 hours of sleep a night have better moods,<br />
        cognition and focus and may enjoy the many body-boosting benefits of GH,<br />
        as compared to those who get less than seven hours of sleep.<br />

        So take your sleep seriously. Be as territorial about it as you are with your time spent at the gym and you’ll likely see your results accelerate drastically.<br />
