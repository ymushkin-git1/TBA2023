        If you’re the typical guy in the gym working with weights, not only do you want to lose some fat, but also gain some muscle.<br />

        This article discusses the mechanisms of how muscles grow, <br />
        plus why most women won’t gain large amounts of muscle when working with weights.<br />

        Although there are different types of muscles, such as cardiac muscle (your heart<br />
        for our concerns, we will talk exclusively about skeletal muscles. <br />
        Skeletal muscle is composed of thread-like myofibrils and sarcomeres that form a muscle fiber and are the basic units of contraction.<br />

        The 650 skeletal muscles in the human body contract when they receive signals from motor neurons,<br />
        which are triggered from a part of the cell called the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<br />
        Motor neurons tell your muscles to contract and the better you become at having those signals tell your muscles to contract,<br />
        the stronger you can get.<br />

        When someone like a powerlifter is able to lift very heavy weight despite not looking very muscular,<br />
        it’s due to their ability to activate those motor neurons and contract their muscles better.<br />
        This is why some powerlifters can be relatively smaller compared to bodybuilders,<br />
        but can lift significantly more weight. Motor Unit recruitment also helps to explain why, after practice,<br />
        certain movements become easier to perform and most of the initial strength gains will be when you first start to lift weights.<br />
        Muscle growth tends to occur more steadily after this initial period of strength gain because you are more easily able to activate the muscles.<br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="py"> id="py" The Physiology Of Muscle Growth</h1>
    <p>
        After you workout, your body repairs or replaces damaged muscle fibers through a cellular process<br />
        where it fuses muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands or myofibrils. <br />
        These repaired myofibrils increase in thickness and number to create muscle hypertrophy (growth).<br />
        Muscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown.<br />
        This adaption, however, does not happen while you actually lift the weights. Instead, it occurs while you rest.<br />

        So how do you actually add muscle to your muscle cells?<br />
        This is where Satellite cells come in and act like stem cells for your muscles.<br />
        When activated, they help to add more nuclei to the muscle cells and therefore contribute directly to the growth of myofibrils (muscle cells).<br />
        Activating these satellite cells may be the difference between what allows certain “genetic freaks” to grow massive muscles and what makes other people “hard-gainers.”<br />

        In one of the most interesting studies in the past 5 years, researchers showed that those who were “extreme responders”<br />
        to muscle growth, with an incredible 58% myofiber hypertrophy from an exercise, had 23% activation of their satellite cells.<br />
        Modest responders, who had a 28% growth, had 19% activation of their satellite cells. What is interesting to note, though,<br />
        is that some people known as “non-responders” in the study had 0% growth and had a concurrent 0% activation of their satellite cells.<br />
        Therefore, it seems the more you can activate these satellite cells, the more you’ll be able to grow. <br />
        So then the question becomes, how do you activate these satellite cells to increase muscle growth?<br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="mec">3 Mechanisms That Make Muscles Grow</h1>
    <p>
        Underlying all progression of natural muscle growth is the ability to continually put more stress on the muscles.<br />
        This stress is a major component involved in the growth of a muscle and disrupts homeostasis within your body. <br />
        The stress and subsequent disruption in homeostasis causes three main mechanisms that spur on muscle growth.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>1. Muscle Tension</h3>
    <p>
        In order to produce muscle growth, you have to apply a load of stress greater than what your body or muscles had previously adapted too.<br />
        How do you do this? The main way is to lift progressively heavier weights.<br />
        This additional tension on the muscle helps to cause changes in the chemistry of the muscle,<br />
        allowing for growth factors that include mTOR activation and satellite cell activation.<br />

        Muscular tension also most dramatically effects the connection of the motor units with the muscle cells.<br />
        Two other factors help to explain why some people can be stronger, but not as big as other people.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>2. Muscle Damage</h3>
    <p>
        If you’ve ever felt sore after a workout, you have experienced the localized muscle damage from working out.<br />
        This local muscle damage causes a release of inflammatory molecules and immune system cells that activate satellite cells to jump into action.<br />
        This doesn’t mean that you have to feel sore in order for this to happen,<br />
        but instead that the damage from the workout has to be present in your muscle cells.<br />
        Typically soreness is attenuated over time by other mechanisms.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>3. Metabolic Stress</h3>
    <p>
        If you’ve ever felt the burn of an exercise or had the “pump” in the gym, then you’ve felt the effects of metabolic stress.<br />
        Scientists used to question bodybuilders when they said the “pump” caused their muscles to become larger.<br />
        After more investigation, it seems as though they were onto something.<br />

        Metabolic stress causes cell swelling around the muscle,
        which helps to contribute to muscle growth without necessarily increasing the size of the muscle cells.<br />
        This is from the addition of muscle glycogen, which helps to swell the muscle along with connective tissue growth.<br />
        This type of growth is known as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and is one of the ways that people can get the appearance of larger muscles without increases in strength.<br />

        So now that you know the three main mechanisms of muscle growth, the next question is: how do hormones affect muscle growth?<br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="hor">How Do Hormones Affect How Muscles Grow?</h1>
    <p>
        Hormones are another component largely responsible for muscle growth and repair because of their role in regulating satellite cell activity.<br />
        Insulin Growth Factor (IGF)-1, in particular Mecho-Growth Factor (MGF) and testosterone are the two most vital mechanisms that promote muscle growth.<br />

        Testosterone is the main hormone that most people think about when working out with weights,<br />
        and there seems to be some validity to the thought that testosterone increases protein synthesis, <br />
        inhibits protein breakdown, activates satellite cells, and stimulates other anabolic hormones.<br />
        Although most testosterone is bound in the body and therefore not available to use (up to 98%),<br />
        strength training seems to help not only release more testosterone,<br />
        but also make the receptors of your muscle cells more sensitive to your free testosterone. <br />
        Testosterone can also stimulate growth hormone responses by increasing the presence of neurotransmitters at the damaged fiber site,<br />
        which can help to activate tissue growth.

        The IGF regulates the amount of muscle mass growth by enhancing protein synthesis, facilitating glucose uptake,<br />
        repartitioning the uptake of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) into skeletal muscles and once again,<br />
        activates satellite cells to increase muscle growth.<br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="rest">Why Muscles Need Rest To Grow</h1>
    <p>
        If you do not provide your body with adequate rest or nutrition<br />
        , you can actually reverse the anabolic process and put your body into a catabolic or destructive state.<br />
        The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts for 24-48 hours; thus,<br />
        the interaction between protein metabolism and any meals consumed in this period will determine the impact of the diet on muscle hypertrophy.<br />
        Keep in mind there is a certain limit on how much your muscles can actually grow dependent on gender, age, and genetics.<br />
        For instance, men have more testosterone than women, which allows them to build bigger and stronger muscles.<br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="rap">Why Rapid Muscle Growth Is Unlikely</h1>
    <p>
        Muscle hypertrophy takes time and is relatively slow for the majority of people.<br />
        People will generally not see visible growth for several weeks or months as most initial changes are due to the ability of your nervous system to activate your muscles.<br />

        In addition to that, different people have different genetics, which range from hormonal output,<br />
        muscle fiber type and number, along with satellite cell activation, that can all limit muscle growth.<br />
        To ensure you’re doing your best to grow muscle, muscle protein synthesis must exceed muscle protein breakdown.<br />
        This requires that you take in an adequate source of protein (especially essential amino acids) and carbohydrates to help facilitate the cellular process of rebuilding broken down muscle tissue.<br />
        Visible muscle growth and evident physical changes in your body’s muscle structure can be highly motivational which is why understanding the science behind how muscles actually grow is important.<br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="con">How Muscles Grow: Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        For muscle breakdown and growth to occur you must force your muscles to adapt by creating stress that is different than the previous threshold your body has already adapted to.<br />
        This is can be done by lifting heavier weights, continually changing your exercises so that you can damage more total muscle fibers and pushing your muscles to fatigue while getting a “pump.”<br />
        After the workout is completed, the most important part begins which is adequate rest and providing ample fuel to your muscles so they can regenerate and grow.<br />
