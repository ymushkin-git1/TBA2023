        <h1>1. Barbell Squat</h1><br />

        <br />
        <div class="divp">
            The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength.
            It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program.
        </div>
        <br />
        <h2>
            How to Do the Barbell Squat
        </h2>
        <div class="divp">



            Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.<br />
            Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.<br />
            Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.

        <h1>2. Leg Press</h1><br />

        <br />
        <div class="divp">
            The leg press is a machine exercise targeting the quadriceps.
            It’s favorite among lifters who prefer the seated position to standing with a load on the spine.

        <h2>
            How to Do Leg Press
        </h2>
        <div class="divp">
            Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance.<br />
            Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.<br />
            As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.<br />
            Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.<br />
            Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.

        <div class="divp">
            Begin standing with your feet about hip-width apart and holding dumbbells in your hands down by your side. This will be your starting position.<br />
            Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips.
            Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should be in line with your front foot. Do not allow your front knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint.<br />
            Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up.<br />
            Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.

            For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position.<br />
            Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.<br />
            Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.<br />
            Repeat for the recommended amount of times.

            Hold a bar at hip level with a pronated (palms facing down) grip. Your shoulders should be back, your back arched, and your knees slightly bent. This will be your starting position.<br />
            Lower the bar by moving your butt back as far as you can. Keep the bar close to your body, your head looking forward, and your shoulders back. Done correctly, you should reach the maximum range of your hamstring flexibility just below the knee. Any further movement will be compensation and should be avoided for this movement.<br />
            At the bottom of your range of motion, return the starting position by driving the hips forward to stand up tall.

        <br />
        <div class="divp">
            The lying leg curl is a popular machine-based exercise for the legs, particularly the hamstrings.
            It is similar to the seated leg curl, but the open hip angle in the lying leg curl may incorporate more glute and calf activation.
            It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a leg pre-exhaust or as a muscle-building movement for lower-body training. .

            Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.<br />
            As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.<br />
            As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

            The goblet squat is a popular lower-body exercise where you hold a kettlebell or dumbbell in front of your chest as if you are supporting a heavy cup or goblet.
            It can help lifters of all levels improve their squat technique and hip mobility, but can also work as a muscle-building or strength accessory movement for experienced athletes.
            It also works well in combinations, complexes, and flows with other kettlebell movements like swings, presses, and cleans.

            Position your legs in the platform using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times.<br />
            Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position)<br />
            Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). <br />
            Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement<br />

        <h1>9. Barbell Glute Bridge </h1><br />

        <br />
        <div class="divp">
            This exercise is very effective at loading the glutes in their shortened position, without the need to load the spine. What separates the glute bridge from the hip thrust is the range of motion.
            The glute bridge utilizes a shorter range of motion, allowing for more bias and muscular tension to be placed on the glutes over other muscles of the posterior chain such as the hamstrings, quads, and spinal erectors.

            Now, roll the barbell towards you, so it’s sitting on your hips. <br />
            Place your upper back on a bench and bend your knees with your feet flat on the floor. <br />
            Squeeze your glutes and drive your hips up, holding onto the barbell with both hands to prevent it from falling until your body is in a straight line from knee to chin. <br />
            Hold this position for a beat and then lower the weight back down.
