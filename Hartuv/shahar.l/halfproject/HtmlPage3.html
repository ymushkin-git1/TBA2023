    <h1>football</h1>
    <p>
        Football's modern origins began in England more than 100 years ago, in 1863. The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in<br />
        old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. It was by the Aztecs called Tchatali, although<br />
        various versions of the game were spread over large regions. In some ritual occasions, the ball would<br />
        symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods. A unique feature<br />
        of the Mesoamerican ball game versions was a bouncing ball made of rubber – no other early culture<br />
        had access to rubber.<br />
        The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century<br />
        BC under the name cuju. Cuju was played with a round ball (stitched leather with fur or feathers inside)<br />
        on an area of a square. A modified form of this game later spread to Japan and was by the name of<br />
        kemari practiced under ceremonial forms.<br />
        Perhaps even older cuju was Marn Gook, played by Aboriginal Australians and according to white<br />
        emigrants in the 1800s a ball game primarily involving kicking. The ball was made by encased leaves<br />
        or roots. The rules are mostly unknown, but as with many other early versions of the game keeping the<br />
        ball in the air was probably a chief feature.<br />
        Other variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was made by shreds of<br />
        leather filled with hair (the first documents of balls filled with air are from the 7th century). Ball games<br />
        had, however, a low status and was not included at the Panhellenic Games. In the Ancient Rome,<br />
        games with balls were not included in the entertainment on the big arenas (amphitheaters), but<br />
        occurred in exercises in the military by the name of Harpastum. It was the Roman culture that would<br />
        bring football to the British island (Britannica). It is, however, uncertain in which degree the British<br />
        people were influenced by this variety and in which degree they had developed their own variants.
        The best football player was Pele<br />
