            lieb Daimler made the first practical vehicle powered by internal combustion in 1885 in Cannstatt in Germany,<br />
            but it was a motorcycle. So the first practical car was produced in the following year (1886) in Mannheim in Germany by Karl Benz (whose name lives on in Mercedes-Benz).
            Founded on 10 October 1794, during the French Revolution,it was then proposed by Abbé Henri Grégoire<br />
            as a "depository for machines, models, tools, drawings, descriptions and books in all the areas of the arts<br />
            and trades". The deserted Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory (and particularly its Gothic refectory by Pierre<br />
            de Montereau) was selected as the site of collection, which officially opened in 1802.<br />
            The collection of inventions is now operated by the Musée des Arts et Métiers. The original Foucault<br />
            pendulum was exhibited as part of the collection, but was moved to the Panthéon in 1995 during museum<br />
            renovation. It was later reinstalled in the Musée des Arts et Métiers. On 6 April 2010, the cable suspending<br />
            the original pendulum bob snapped causing irreparable damage to the pendulum and to the marble flooring<br />
            of the museum.The fastest production car in the world in terms of projected figures (before an official run has been made) is the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut,<br />
            with a calculated top speed target of over 310mph<br />
