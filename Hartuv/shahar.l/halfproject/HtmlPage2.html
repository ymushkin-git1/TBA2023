        <h1> all about skate boards </h1>
        <p>


            The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom.<br />
            Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which<br />
            formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of<br />
            today.<br />
            Skateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do<br />
            when the waves were flat. This was called "sidewalk surfing" – a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No<br />
            one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards<br />
            were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the<br />
            Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was<br />
            originally denoted "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.<br />
            By the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards<br />
            that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's<br />
            founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of<br />
            skateboarders were also featured on a television show called Surf's Up in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as<br />
            something new and fun to do.<br />
