        <h1>basket ball history:</h1>

                In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International<br />
                Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was<br />
                trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students<br />
                occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either<br />
                too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to<br />
                teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic<br />
                rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact,<br />
                which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so<br />
                Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.<br />
                Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from "association football"<br />
                were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for<br />
                inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover<br />
                had been flipped outside-in. These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to<br />
                be unpredictable. Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this<br />
                change to the game was endorsed by Naismith (whereas in American football, the lace<br />
                construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day). The first<br />
                balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that<br />
                Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike,<br />
                introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass"<br />
                to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but<br />
                limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.[dubious – discuss] Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the<br />
                double dribble by 1898.<br />
