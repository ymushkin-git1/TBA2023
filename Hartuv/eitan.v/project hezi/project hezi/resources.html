                        <h2>Common Threats And How To Aviod Them</h2>
                        <h4>
                            <br>The world of computers and internet is so wide and overwhlming. There are many loopholes and weak
                            points in your computer that you may not know of. These things can cuase you damage in the future and
                            there are some steps you can take to reduce the chance of them.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1. Phishing Attacks:</h3>
                        <h4>
                            Phishing attacks are the most common security breach. This attack is very simple, what may look like an
                            innocent text from a friend asking you to click or forward a link, download a file, or send sensitive
                            information such as usernames and passwords to them may actually have a stranger waiting on the other
                            side.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            Doing any of the actions listed above can lead to a breach in your device and loss of accounts personal
                            information and even access to other devices connected to yours, anyone can be anyone on the internet.
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h3>2. Malware Attacks: </h3>
                        <h4>
                            Similar to Phising, Malware is dependent on a user to press a link forward it or download a file. The
                            difference is that these links are hidden under add faces and pictures, behind movie download options and
                            much more.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            The best tip we can give you is not to press those links. Avoid downloading random files without knowing
                            their orgin you don't know what they contain. A trip to the Maldives for 30 bucks is too good to be true;)
                        </h4>
                        <br>
                        <h3>3. RansomWare Attacks: </h3>
                        <h4>
                            A ransom attack is usually used to collect money from an innocent user through bitcoin by encrypting
                            their files and holding them for ransom. This attack has many ways of creeping up on you. Like Phishing
                            and Malware it can be "self induced" or unexpectedly pop up on your computer.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            For example a famous global Ransom attack that happened in 2017 called "WannaCry" exploited a weakness
                            in microsoft's url, this attack inflicted 230 thousand computers world wide that used unupdated versions
                            of microsoft related devices.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            To avoid this dangerous attack one must make sure their computer is up to date with its system so no
                            unexpected breches could happen, and remeber no clicking random links on the internet.<br>

                        <h4>
                            Having a weak and guessable password is a common threat many people face. It's hard remebering a long
                            password with different charecters symbols and numbers but having a pin with 4 numbers in it can be
                            breached quite easily.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            We have to recomondations to help you. One is to use a password managing software such as lastPass which
                            is a great free option. Two is to make a difficult to guess password and keep a physical copy of it with
                            you for easier remebering that is not connected to the internet.<br>
